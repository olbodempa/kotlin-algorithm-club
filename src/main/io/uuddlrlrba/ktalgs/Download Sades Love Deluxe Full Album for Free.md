Love Deluxe is not only a musical masterpiece, but also a personal and emotional expression of Sade's life and experiences. The album was inspired by her turbulent relationship with Spanish filmmaker Carlos Pliego, who she married in 1989 and divorced in 1995. The songs reflect her feelings of love, pain, longing, and resilience. For example, No Ordinary Love is about the struggle to maintain a passionate and faithful bond in the face of distance and temptation. Pearls is a tribute to the women of Somalia, who Sade admired for their strength and dignity despite the hardships they faced.
 
The album also showcases Sade's unique and distinctive style, which blends elements of soul, jazz, R&B, pop, and world music. She collaborated with her longtime band members Stuart Matthewman, Andrew Hale, and Paul Spencer Denman, who co-wrote and co-produced the songs with her. The album features minimal instrumentation and production, relying mostly on Sade's vocals and Matthewman's guitar and saxophone. The result is a smooth and sophisticated sound that is both timeless and contemporary.
