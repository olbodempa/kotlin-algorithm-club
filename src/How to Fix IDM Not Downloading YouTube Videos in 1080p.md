In this article, we will explain why IDM does not download YouTube videos in 1080p and how to fix it. We will also share some tips on how to optimize your video downloads with IDM and avoid common errors.
  
## Why IDM Does Not Download YouTube Videos in 1080p
 
The reason why IDM does not download YouTube videos in 1080p is that YouTube has changed the way it streams videos. YouTube now uses a technology called Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) to deliver videos in different resolutions and formats. DASH allows YouTube to adjust the video quality based on the network conditions and the device capabilities of the viewer.
 
However, DASH also makes it harder for third-party downloaders like IDM to capture the video stream. IDM can only download the audio and video separately and then merge them into one file. This means that IDM cannot download videos that have DASH-only formats, such as 1080p, 4K, and 8K.

There are two main ways to fix IDM not downloading YouTube videos in 1080p: using a browser extension or using a video converter.
  
### Using a Browser Extension
 
One way to fix IDM not downloading YouTube videos in 1080p is to use a browser extension that can bypass the DASH restriction and allow IDM to download the video as a single file. There are many browser extensions that can do this, such as Video DownloadHelper, SaveFrom.net Helper, or YouTube Video Downloader. Here are the steps to use a browser extension to download YouTube videos in 1080p with IDM:
 
1. Install the browser extension of your choice from the official website or the browser's web store.
2. Open the YouTube video that you want to download in your browser.
3. Click on the browser extension icon and select the desired resolution and format. You should see an option for 1080p MP4 or WebM.
4. Right-click on the download link and choose "Download with IDM" from the context menu.
5. IDM will start downloading the video as a single file in 1080p resolution.

### Using a Video Converter
 
Another way to fix IDM not downloading YouTube videos in 1080p is to use a video converter that can merge the audio and video files into one file after downloading them separately with IDM. There are many video converters that can do this, such as VLC Media Player, Format Factory, or Freemake Video Converter. Here are the steps to use a video converter to download YouTube videos in 1080p with IDM:

1. Open the YouTube video that you want to download in your browser.
2. Right-click on the video player and choose "Copy video URL" from the context menu.
3. Open IDM and click on "Add URL" button.
4. Paste the copied URL into the dialog box and click "OK".
5. IDM will start downloading the audio and video files separately in different resolutions and formats.
6. Once the download is complete, open the video converter of your choice and add both files to it.
7. Select the output format as MP4 or WebM and choose the resolution as 1080p.
8. Click on "Convert" or "Start" button and wait for the conversion process to finish.
9. The video converter will merge the audio and video files into one file in 1080p resolution.
