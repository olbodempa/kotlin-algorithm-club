Unfortunately, Native Instruments Pro 53 VST is no longer available for purchase or download from the official website. However, there are some ways you can still get it for free if you are willing to do some digging. Here are some possible options:
 
- Check out the free VST plugins bundle from Native Instruments called KOMPLETE START[^1^]. This bundle includes over 2,000 sounds and more than 6 GB of content, including drums, basses, synths, effects, and more. You can also get REAKTOR PLAYER, KONTAKT PLAYER, and KOMPLETE KONTROL for free. These are powerful platforms that run many NI instruments and effects, including some that are based on the Prophet-5 sound. For example, you can try MONARK, a monophonic synth that captures the essence of the Prophet-5's oscillator and filter design.
- Look for online sources that offer Pro 53 VST as a free download. There are some websites that claim to have Pro 53 VST available for free download, but be careful as they might not be trustworthy or legal. Some of them might require you to complete surveys, sign up for newsletters, or download other software that might contain malware or viruses. Always scan any files you download with a reliable antivirus program before installing them on your computer.
- Search for second-hand copies of Pro 53 VST on online marketplaces or forums. You might be able to find someone who is willing to sell or give away their copy of Pro 53 VST if they no longer use it or have upgraded to a newer version. However, make sure you check the license agreement and terms of service of Native Instruments before transferring or receiving any software from another user. You might need to register the product with your own account or activate it online before using it.

## Best Alternatives to Pro 53 VST
 
If you are looking for other options besides Pro 53 VST, you might want to check out some of the best alternatives that offer similar or better features and sound quality. Here are some of our recommendations:

- **MONARK by Native Instruments**: This is a monophonic synth plugin that is part of the KOMPLETE START bundle[^1^], but you can also buy it separately. It is inspired by the Prophet-5 and other classic analog synths, and it delivers a warm, fat, and punchy sound. It has three oscillators, a 24dB low-pass filter with feedback, two envelopes, and an LFO. You can also tweak the tuning, drift, saturation, and noise parameters to add more character and realism to your sound.
- **U-he Repro**: This is a bundle of two synth plugins that faithfully recreate the sound of the Prophet-5 and the Prophet-1. Repro-5 is a polyphonic synth with five voices, while Repro-1 is a monophonic synth with a single voice. Both plugins have two oscillators, a mixer, a filter, an amplifier, two envelopes, an LFO, a modulation matrix, and an effects section. They also have a built-in sequencer and arpeggiator for creating rhythmic patterns. The sound quality of Repro is stunning, and it captures the nuances and imperfections of the original hardware.
- **Arturia Prophet V**: This is another bundle of two synth plugins that emulate the Prophet-5 and the Prophet-VS. The Prophet-VS was a vector synthesis synth that used four digital oscillators with different waveforms to create complex timbres. Arturia Prophet V combines both synths into one plugin, allowing you to mix and match their features and create hybrid sounds. You can also use the third mode, which is a hybrid of both synths with additional modulation options.
- **TAL-U-NO-LX**: This is a synth plugin that models the Roland Juno-60, which was another iconic analog synth from the 80s. It has two oscillators with pulse width modulation, a sub-oscillator, a noise generator, a 24dB low-pass filter with resonance, an ADSR envelope, an LFO, a chorus effect, and a portamento function. It sounds very close to the original Juno-60, and it has a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to use.
- **Glitch 1.3 by Illformed**: This is not a synth plugin, but an effect plugin that can add some interesting glitches and twists to your sound[^3^]. It has nine modules that you can arrange in any order you want: tape stop, modulator, retrigger, shuffler, reverser, crusher, gater, delay, and stretcher. You can also use the sequencer to trigger different effects at different times. Glitch 1.3 is great for creating rhythmic variations, stutter effects, pitch shifts, and more.

These are some of the best alternatives to Pro 53 VST that you can try for free or buy online. They all offer different features and sound quality that can suit your needs and preferences. Whether you want to recreate the classic analog synth sound or experiment with new possibilities, these plugins can help you achieve your musical goals.
